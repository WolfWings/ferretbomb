<h1>Streaming Hours</h1>
<p>I make an effort to be live by <b>Midnight CST</b> (10pm PST, 6am GMT), and normally run until at least <b>4am</b> (and usually go much later, until 6-7am).</p>
<p>Casting days are based on PST start-time, on the 'if I haven't slept, it's not tomorrow yet' rule.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thursday: League night! League of Legends.</li>
<li>Friday: Payday (2)! (Semi-suspended until new content)</li>
<li>Saturday: Community Night! All multiplayer games with members of the community.</li>
<li>Sunday: Subday Sunday! Subs vote on the game I play, and get first-dibs on multiplayer slots today only.</li>
<li>Drunken Burnout Ferretdise: the first Saturday of each month.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have not currently taken on a streaming challenge, so I am not guaranteed-live <i>every</i> night, but I am more consistently here than not; normally only missing (or a bit late) due to midnight showings of movies, tabletop gaming nights, or other RL complications (such as work-related emergencies, fire, flood, and alien abduction to save the universe).</p>

<div class="brick">

<p>I use a 2500kbps video stream with a 2500kbps buffer, and a CBR encoding. Audio is AAC with a 128kbps bitrate at 44.1khz Stereo, with a 300ms Mic Time Offset.</p>
<p>I have Multithreaded Optimizations set to on, at an Above Normal priority, and a Veryfast h.264 preset.</p>
