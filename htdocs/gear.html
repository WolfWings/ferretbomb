<h1>Streaming Equipment</h1>
<p>Here you'll find a list of my streaming gear, along with links for where to pick most of it up (via the Amazon Affiliate program to help support the stream)! I eventually mean to break this up into 'tiers', allowing new casters to get good results with minimal outlay of cash for gear that they can carry forward to the next tier(s).</p>
<a name="webcams"></a>
<h2>Webcams</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">Logitech c920 Webcam</a>
		<p>Probably the best cam you can (currently) buy, without going into ridiculous pricing ranges for actual professional production gear (and a x100 price multiplier, give or take). This is one of your core items; having yourself on-screen (even just tiny!) will create a much stronger connection between yourself and your audience. Body language is powerful; why I list it here at the top. Any cheapo will do temporarily, but to look <i>great</i>, this is the only option, in my mind.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<a name="lighting"></a>
<h2>Lighting</h2>
<p>Related to the webcam, and almost as important. A good lighting setup will make your cam work better, and make the next section work better. The important thing to decide at the beginning is what color temperature you want to use, and stick with; 5000-6500K will give you 'daylight', allowing easier recording without resorting to blackout shades during the day and giving you better color reproduction... but it's a LOT harder on eyestrain from my experience. Also, these bulbs are much harder to source locally at any decent price.</p>
<p>Personally, I use 2700K bulbs. Cheaper than the 'daylight' bulbs, easier on the eyes, the colors are MUCH warmer (good for relaxed, casual streaming), and available at almost any nearby store as 'soft white' bulbs (check the K rating printed on the bulb though to be certain!). If you have a Logitech c920 (above) you can adjust the white balance to give very close color reproduction, but if you plan to cast during the day, expect to buy a set of 'blackout curtains' or to apply tinfoil/other blocking material to your windows. Any stray sunlight getting in will mess with the color balance, cause hotspots, and lead to issues.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">
		<img src="http://www.ferretbomb.com/images/FB_cons_splash.png" alt="Product Image Placeholder">
		<br>Generic bowl-reflector clamp lights</a>
		<p>I bought two of these from my local Home Depot for about $10-15 apiece, with the 'strong clamp' base to make sure they won't shift/slip around. These do not have diffusers (though I am looking into a way to fit one on) so will cause a fairly harsh light, with reflected hot-spots if you wear glasses.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">FancierStudio 2000W Lighting Kit</a>
		<p>Five-bulb heads, inner and outer diffuser elements, comes with bulbs (5500K, if you're going for high-temp color, otherwise will need to buy replacements). The only down sides to these are that the stands are pretty flimsy/wobbly, and they're HUGE. Truly immense. If you've only got a small space set aside for casting, you do not want these. They're each the size of a movie poster, and about as deep as one too (counting space for the stand base). The head can handle four 'fat boy' gigantor bulbs though, with a smaller one in the center; the individually switched sockets also allows you to 'dim' it by only turning on some of the bulbs (or change between color temps if you populate some with one temp, and the rest with another).</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">Super Pro Lighting Kit</a>
		<p>Multiple stand lights, a boom mounted hair-light, par cans, fills and reflectors galore. If you have a permanent studio, pick this up. You'll find a use for all of the parts.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">LED panels</a>
		<p>These are probably the best you can get; super bright, cool-running (even moreso than CFLs), long-lasting, super small/slimline. The down side? They're SUPER EXPENSIVE for good ones. Also, you'll need to fit a diffuser element in front, as the panels give a very intense, directed light; not what you really want, especially in tight quarters, unless you know how to light dramatically and are going for that look. If I do a dedicated studio and could write off the price of these on my taxes? I'd go all-LED for the heat reduction, power usage drop, compactness, and reliability (almost never should have a good one burn out unexpectedly).</p>

<h2>Studio Equipment</h2>
<a name="green_screens"></a>
<h3>Green Screens</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">LimoStudio 10'x10' Muslin Chromakey Green backdrop w/ stand</a>
		<p>At a whopping $37, I couldn't believe this deal. The muslin is a little thin, but the stands are nice and sturdy (if light-duty). For less than most bedsheet sets at Wal-Mart, you can pick one of these up. Also adjusts from 5' wide to 10' in 2.5' increments (adding segments to the hanging truss). These went out of stock shortly after I grabbed mine, but worth watching in case they come back in-stock.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">More expensive green screen</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="streamers"></a>
<h3>Steamers</h3>
<p>I won't say much here aside from that when working with a muslin greenscreen, a cheap garment steamer is a LIFESAVER. You can't iron muslin without risking damaging it (and destroying your backdrop), and the 'crinkle method' where you get it SO wrinkly that any folds don't show... just sucks. Spend ~$30 on a garment steamer, spend half an hour, and get your screen looking GREAT (and easier to key out with no sparkles)! As an added bonus, you can steam work clothing, set creases, and generally make your home look more awesome at the same time. :D Be warned, steam is freaking HOT!</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">Homedics Garment Steamer</a>
		<p>I picked this up, and it works excellent if you read the directions and take a little care with it. Takes forever to dry out the reservoir after each use though.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">Handheld Garment Steamer</a>
		<p>The reservoir on this is pretty small, only really suitable for a shirt and a pair of pants. Expect to refill it often.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">Wagner Wallpaper Steamer</a>
		<p>Surprisingly, this will work as well; as it has a larger head, it will be easier to get the material smoothed out. Just be careful, some of these have sharp spikes or even blades on them to help get the wallpaper off... you don't want these to rip your muslin apart!</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<a name="capture_cards"></a>
<h2>Capture Cards</h2>
<p>Let me preface this section by saying that if you do not intend to stream console games or a very few selected "hacker proof" games that prevent memory read-hooking, a capture card in your streaming system will do you NO GOOD WHATSOEVER. OBS/XSplit cannot use the onboard hardware encoder (which tend to look like crap anyway). All compositing is still going to be done by the video card. All of the encoding will still be loaded onto your CPU. If you have a secondary, devoted encoding machine, having one of these becomes useful (but has its own challenges, addressed in the <a href="http://dummy.link.here">streaming setup/configurations</a> section of the site).</p>
<p>That said, here are my top units, in increasing order.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">AverMedia LiveGamer HD (Portable?)</a>
		<p>Relatively cheap, with passable performance; the on-board encoder looks like complete crap and requires you use RecCentral to utilize it. Color quality is a common complaint, and the performance specs are a bit overstated. The Portable might deliver better results, but as a new bit of kit, it's yet to be seen how well it actually performs, past the press releases. If you just occasionally will dip into console play, this could be an option. These devices have been known to behave erratically with OBS at times, and the Portable may not even work (due to compressing its output before sending it to the host PC).</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">BlackMagic Intensity Pro</a>
		<p>A cut above the Avermedia options. More expensive to match the quality increase though. If you stream console games regularly, this is a good target.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">Framemeister</a>
		<p>At $expensive (~$400USD at last check), the Framemeister is the heavy-hitter here. If you plan on streaming a TON of console games (especially 240p stuff like the NES/SNES/Genesis/etc), this is the cream of the crop. Just about the best you can realistically get, while still using the actual console hardware.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<a name="monitors"></a>
<h2>Monitors</h2>
A very personal-preference category; more than one is almost a necessity to go pro, so you can push your chat off to one and leave the game fullscreened on the other. Beyond that, it's up to you; a HUGE TV set in front of your desk by a few feet (allowing you to set the camera in front of it on a tripod without covering up much of the screen, Man vs Game style)? An ultra-panoramic three (or more!) monitor arrangement (like mine)? It's all your call. 16:9 is strongly recommended, and 1920x1080 or better resolution per monitor (note, 1920x1200 is 16:10, and can cause issues! 16:9 is the more important consideration). My recommendations:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">HP w2338h Wide LCD Monitor</a>
		<p>I use three of these in an 'extend' configuration (as opposed to 'Span' which would treat the three as a single large monitor... good for ultra-panoramic gaming, but troublesome for streaming!) and have had no problems with them at all.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">Samsung UN40D6400 40" 3D HDTV</a>
		<p>I have this for my living-room gaming. Some like 3D. Some hate it. I'm in the former camp after having played Wipeout HD/Fury, and re-played ICO and Shadow of the Colossus in 3D. They truly show off why 3D is the future of gaming, in my opinion... breathtaking vistas, incredible sense of scale, and outright vertigo in many cases. Movies kind of suck in 3D. Games? Nope. I only recommend this model as I own one and it works well; in retrospect, I should have bought a passive-glasses (theater) set instead; active glasses have crosstalk/timing problems that can cause double-images and 'ghosting'.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<a name="peripherals"></a>
<h2>Peripherals</h2>
<p>This is almost entirely determined by your gaming preferences. I believe just about any streamer should at <i>least</i> own a wired XBox360 controller (Official, Razer Onza, Sabertooth, Afterglow, etc); in short, a gamepad. Many games work well with these, they can be remapped easily with free software for other games, and some (like Binding of Isaac) are nearly totally different games when you make the switch. Not saying to use it for everything, but it's an option you'll definitely want.</p>
<p>Keyboard. Any will do; be aware that mechanicals are GREAT, but also LOUD. If you want to keep typing sounds to a minimum, consider a membrane keyboard, or a mechanical with Cherry Brown MX switches.. a nice tradeoff between crisp actuation and noise level.</p>
<p>Mouse. In this age, even a cheapo will work well. That said, Logitech and Razer mice come with very handy software, and other options as well as usability. I lean on the Razer side of the fence myself, with a Mamba (make sure you have spare batteries or run it wired only!) and a Naga (so many buttons!) that I swap between depending on what I plan to play. I've been leaving the Naga on more often lately though.</p>
<p>Speedpad. These are totally optional, and may be hype. Still, I love my Belkin(/Razer) Nostromo n52te, especially for MOBA play. Adding a hat switch on the thumb opens up a LOT of options for alternate control methods. Also a lot more comfortable to use than most keyboards.</p>
<a name="other_stuff"></a>
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">A comfortable chair.</a>
		<p>This one should go without saying. Unless you're standing or <a href="http://twitch.tv/time_warden">walking to Mordor</a>, you're going to need somewhere to sit for long periods. It'd better be somewhere you enjoy.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://pending.amazon.link">A desk.</a>
		<p>Again, obvious, but you want something with enough space to work with comfortably. Being stuck cramped to a tiny TV tray can work, but you'll be happier (and it will come across) if you have room to stretch out. Or put streaming supplies like props/hats/sunglasses/toys while not in-use.</p>
